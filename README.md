### What I Learned
Rock, Paper, Scissors is the first project where I had creative control over how I was going to create it. Since rock, paper, scissor is such a common game, I wanted to make mine unique by creating a cool theme. I recalled the classic three-way deadlock between Snail, Frog, and Snake as inspiration and I'm satisfied with how it turned out.

I got to use many of JavaScript's basic commands and features while creating this project. For instance, I was able to use the fundamental querySelectors and dynamic eventListeners. Both of which are incredibly important for just about any website. This project was especially heavy on conditional statements, functions, and manipulating parameters. This was a very fun project that got me started in JavaScript.
